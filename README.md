### Responses
> Different Responses given out by the API, are listed here.

If any error occurs the value of the error key will be set to `true` else `false`
```JSON
"error": false //no error occured
```
Most of the lyrics are time synced or have timetags and some aren't time synced or have timetags. To differentiate between synced and unsynced we have key `syncType`.
```JSON
"syncType": "LINE_SYNCED"
```
> Musixmatch supports Line synced and Word synced type of timed lyrics. Line Synced is the timetag is given till which the line is sang and the word synced lyrics time specifed when the word comes up in the song. For now Spotify only supports line synced. Maybe they would support word synced in the future :/.

__LINE Synced__
```JSON
{
    "error": false,
    "syncType": "LINE_SYNCED",
    "lines": [
        {
            "timeTag": "00:00.96",
            "words": "One, two, three, four"
        },
        {
            "timeTag": "00:04.02",
            "words": "Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh"
        }
    ]
}
```
__NOT Synced or Unsynced__
> Note the `timeTags` is set to `00:00.00`.
```JSON
{
    "error": false,
    "syncType": "UNSYNCED",
    "lines": [
        {
            "timeTag": "00:00.00",
            "words": "jaane nahin denge tuje"
        },
        {
            "timeTag": "00:00.00",
